sensei_name: Andrew Thrower Sensei, 5th Dan
sensei_bio: "Andrew Thrower Sensei started his martial arts training as a teenager in 1996 when he joined the Tai Gyoku Ryu Aikijujutsu dojo and became a student of the late Gerd Kroell Sensei. It was during these early years that he first met John Honisz-Greens Sensei holder of Joden Kyohan, at various Aikijujutsu seminars in East Sussex.<br><br>

In 2000, and with the encouragement of Kroell Sensei, Andrew Sensei and Nick Bland Sensei began to study Iaido under Honisz-Greens Sensei and have been his students ever since. The first Sussex Dojo was formed by Andrew Sensei and Nick Sensei in August 2000 in Eastbourne, East Sussex. At that time, Honisz-Greens Sensei was living in Japan and would make regular visits to the UK. During these visits Andrew Sensei and Nick Sensei would arrange intense study seminars so that the three of them could practise together during the short time Honisz-Greens Sensei was in the UK. In June 2009 Andrew Sensei opened the second Sussex Dojo based in Sompting, West Sussex.<br><br>

Thrower Sensei currently holds the rank of Godan (5th Dan) in Iaido, which he passed at his first attempt in July 2016 at the British Kendo Association summer seminar at Cambridge University. He is a Level 1 coach and currently working on his preparation for Rokudan (6th Dan) under the guidance of Honisz-Greens Sensei. Andrew Sensei also still practises Aikido and holds a Nidan (2nd dan) in Aikido and a Shoden Kyohan in Aikijujutsu."

Andrew Sensei has had the privilege of being selected to represent Great Britain at the European Iaido Championships on two occasions; Paris in 2003 and Turin (Italy) in 2017, participating in both the individuals and team events. Some members of the Dojo have also visited and trained in Japan on a number of occasions. The Dojo has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere with a range of grades from entry level to 5th dan.
