sensei_name: Andrew Thrower Sensei, 5th Dan
sensei_bio: "Andrew Sensei started his martial arts training as a teenager in 1996 when he joined the Tai Gyoku Ryu Aikido and Aikijujutsu Dojo and became a student of the late Gerd Kroell Sensei. It was during these early years that he met John Honisz-Greens Sensei at various Aikijujutsu seminars in East Sussex. In 2000, and with the encouragement of Kroell Sensei, Andrew Sensei and Nick Bland Sensei (our other Sussex 5th Dan Sensei) began to study Iaido under Honisz-Greens Sensei and have been his students ever since. The first Sussex Dojo was formed by Andrew and Nick Senseis in August 2000 in Eastbourne, East Sussex. At that time, Honisz-Greens Sensei was living in Japan and would make regular visits to the UK. During these visits Andrew and Nick Senseis would arrange intense study seminars so that the three of them could practice together during the short time Honisz-Greens Sensei was in the UK.<br><br>

Andrew has had the privilege of being selected to represent Great Britain at the European Iaido Championships on two occasions; Paris in 2003 and Turin (Italy) in 2017, participating in both the individuals and team events. Some members of the Dojo have also visited and trained in Japan on a number of occasions, including most recently in November 2022. Thrower Sensei currently holds the rank of Godan (5th Dan) in Iaido, which he passed at his first attempt in July 2016 at the British Kendo Association summer seminar at Cambridge University. He is a Level 1 coach and currently working on his preparation for Rokudan (6th Dan) under the guidance of Honisz-Greens Sensei. Andrew also still practices Aikido and holds a Nidan (2nd dan) in Aikido and a Shoden Kyohan in Aikijujutsu."

In June 2009 Andrew Sensei opened the West Sussex Dojo based in Sompting, West Sussex. Since it was established, the Dojo has grown and now has several dedicated long-term members. The Dojo regularly takes part and competes in regional and national Iaido competitions in the UK, and has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere with a range of grades from entry level to 5th dan. The Dojo is based at the Sompting Village Hall, which is at the heart of the local village community. Because the Dojo has been represented at the community village hall for so long, Andrew represents the Dojo as a member of the hall committee in the role of trustee.
