para1: The Tokyo Adachi Roshukai is a group dedicated to the study of Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu Iai (Yamauchi-ha).  Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu (MJER) originates from Tosa Province (modern day Kochi), an extensive area of Japan which was ruled by the Yamauchi clan throughout the Edo Period.  The Tokyo Adachi Roshukai was formed and led by Honda Masayoshi Jushin sensei who was awarded Iaijutsu Kongen no Maki from his teacher Onoue Masamitsu sensei and also held the rank of Kyoshi 7dan from the ZNKR. From Onoue sensei, our lineage goes back through Kono Kanemitsu, Yamanouchi Toyotake, and Oe Masaji sensei. Honda sensei was also a student of Iwata Norikazu sensei, the founder of the Roshukai.
para2: Yamanouchi Toyotake sensei (1903 - 1946) held the title of viscount and was a direct student of 17th generation instructor Oe Masaji (1852 - 1927).  He was one of multiple students to receive the Iaijutsu Kongen no Maki, a scroll signifying complete transmission.  As the grandson of daimyo Yamauchi Yodo, Oe sensei's former lord, he was taught iai befitting a lord.  While the core remains the same, this manifests through small stylistic differences from other branches of MJER.

para4: Honda Masayoshi Jushin Sensei (1936 -2022) devoted himself to the practice of iai for over 50 years and formed and led the Adachi Roshukai branch for over three decades. His strength of character and passion for iai was an inspiration for many students both in Japan and around the world. Honda sensei was posthumously awarded a Kensho-jo (顕彰状, official commendation) from the ZNKR in 2023 for his contribution to the federation and development of iai.
