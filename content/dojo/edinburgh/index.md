para2: The Edinburgh Dojo was formed in late 2001 by David McLean with oversight and support from John Honisz-Greens. Following Honisz-Greens sensei’s prolonged stay in Japan, McLean sensei developed the club over the following 15 years, before moving full time to the Scottish Borders and opening up the Borders dojo.

para3: The Edinburgh dojo is now run by David Hickey sensei, who began studying iaido in 2006 and attained the rank of fifth dan in 2018 at first attempt. Hickey sensei is ably assisted by Matt Bielby sensei, who will attempt his fifth dan in 2020. The Edinburgh club has a range of student abilities at all levels - from ungraded, first dan, all the way through to fifth dan. It’s a great club with good people and a welcoming atmosphere, in a superb location.
